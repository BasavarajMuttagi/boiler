# Transforms may need to be adjusted during the project setup phase

## font-weight

The transformation of the `fontWeight` values currently relies on an mapping object in `font-weight.js`.

```js
const fontWeightMapping = { Light: 300, Regular: 400, SemiBold: 600, Bold: 700 };
```

The font weights may need to be adjusted to match the figma 'fontWeight' types.
